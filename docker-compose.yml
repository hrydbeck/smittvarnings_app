    # By default the watcher runs node jasen_out_watcher.js in the container
    # If you need the watcher to be able to run `docker run` (reportree) from inside
    # the container then mount the docker socket here (optional / advanced):
    # volumes:
    #   - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

  # Optional: a stopped R service is available if you want to exec into it

# Note:
# - This compose file builds a single image (watcher) that has both R and Node installed.
# - The watcher spawns Rscript locally (inside container). Reportree is run via `docker run` in
#   the included `run_reportree.js` and therefore requires Docker to be available from the host
#   or the watcher container (see comment about mounting /var/run/docker.sock above).
