# Note:
# - This compose file builds a single image (watcher) that has both R and Node installed.
# - The watcher spawns Rscript locally (inside container). Reportree is run via `docker run` in
#   the included `run_reportree.js` and therefore requires Docker to be available from the host
#   or the watcher container (see comment about mounting /var/run/docker.sock above).
